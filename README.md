Key Findings

The user accessed a malicious site impersonating Google Authenticator.
Multiple C2 servers were contacted for payload download and persistent communication.
TLS traffic on non-standard ports and IP reputation confirmed malicious behavior.

Recommendations

Isolate and reimage the infected host.
Block the malicious domain and C2 IPs at firewall and DNS level.
Rotate user credentials for shutcherson.
Conduct full endpoint and domain audit for lateral movement.
Improve user awareness and filtering of malicious ads/phishing.
